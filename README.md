# VulnShop - Vulnerable Web Application for Penetration Testing Training

A deliberately vulnerable web application designed for cybersecurity training and penetration testing practice.

## ⚠️ WARNING

**This application contains intentional security vulnerabilities. NEVER deploy this on a public network or production environment!**

This is for **educational purposes only** and should only be run in isolated, controlled environments.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

VulnShop is designed to help cybersecurity students and professionals practice identifying and exploiting common web application vulnerabilities in a legal, safe environment.

### Vulnerabilities Included:
- SQL Injection (Authentication bypass, Data extraction)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected and Stored
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- Unrestricted File Upload
- Broken Access Control
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Information Disclosure
- Weak Authentication
- Security Misconfiguration
- Missing Security Headers

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. **Create the project directory structure:**
```bash
mkdir vulnshop
cd vulnshop
mkdir app db_init
```

2. **Create all the required files:**

Save the following files in their respective locations:
- `docker-compose.yml` (root directory)
- `Dockerfile` (root directory)
- `nginx.conf` (root directory)
- `default.conf` (root directory)
- `app/index.php`
- `app/login.php`
- `app/search.php`
- `app/profile.php`
- `app/upload.php`
- `app/admin.php`
- `app/config.php.bak`
- `db_init/init.sql`
- `README.md` (root directory)
- `HINTS.md` (root directory)

3. **Start the application:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. **Wait for services to initialize** (about 30 seconds for MySQL)

5. **Access the application:**
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Stopping the Application
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Cleanup (Remove all data)
```bash
docker-compose down -v
rm -rf app/uploads/*
```

## 🔐 Default Credentials

The application comes with pre-configured user accounts:

| Username | Password | Role  |
|----------|----------|-------|
| admin    | admin123 | admin |
| john     | password | user  |
| alice    | 123456   | user  |
| bob      | qwerty   | user  |

## 🧪 Testing Environment

### Recommended Tools:
- **Burp Suite Community Edition** - HTTP proxy and web scanner
- **OWASP ZAP** - Web application security scanner
- **SQLMap** - SQL injection tool
- **curl** - Command-line HTTP client
- **Browser DevTools** - Built-in browser tools

### Sample Testing Commands:

**Test SQL Injection:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login.php \
  -d "username=admin' OR '1'='1'--&password=anything"
```

**Test XSS:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/search.php?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
```

**Test IDOR:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/profile.php?id=1
curl http://localhost:8080/profile.php?id=2
```

**Find backup files:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/config.php.bak
```

## 📚 Learning Resources

For detailed hints on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, see **HINTS.md**

### Methodology:
1. **Reconnaissance** - Explore the application, identify functionality
2. **Enumeration** - Map out pages, parameters, and entry points
3. **Vulnerability Identification** - Test for common vulnerabilities
4. **Exploitation** - Demonstrate the security impact
5. **Documentation** - Record findings as you would in a real pentest

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure ports 8080 and 3306 are not in use
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`

**Database connection errors:**
- Wait longer for MySQL to initialize
- Check database container: `docker-compose logs db`

**File upload not working:**
- Ensure uploads directory has proper permissions
- Check: `docker-compose exec web ls -la /var/www/html/uploads`

**Pages showing PHP errors:**
- This is expected behavior in a vulnerable application
- The errors themselves can be information disclosure vulnerabilities

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Never Do This:
- ❌ Deploy on public internet
- ❌ Use on a network with sensitive systems
- ❌ Test on systems you don't own
- ❌ Share publicly accessible instances

### Best Practices:
- ✅ Run in isolated network/VM
- ✅ Use only for authorized training
- ✅ Document findings professionally
- ✅ Learn the remediation methods
- ✅ Destroy environment when done

## 📖 OWASP Top 10 Mapping

This application demonstrates vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10:

1. **A01:2021 – Broken Access Control** (IDOR, unauthorized access)
2. **A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures** (plaintext passwords)
3. **A03:2021 – Injection** (SQL injection)
4. **A04:2021 – Insecure Design** (no security controls)
5. **A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration** (exposed backups, weak configs)
